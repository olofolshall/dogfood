Homeassistant automation with a zigbee button when dogs have been feed

This project ended up as a nessiceity when I was back home visiing my dad in the US. We have two dogs and every moring in the group chat there was "Did someone feed the dogs already?"; and I thought there needed to by a better way of dealing with this. Homeassitant was the perfect platform since it was already installed and with a cheap zigbee button there could be a physical interface too!

## Project Objectives
1. Know if the dogs have been fed
2. Remind us to feed the dogs if they haven't?
3. Work for both moring and evening feeding
